# Environment file for instantiating
#  - 1 x HA RTP MSC pair - A instance
#
# During initial instantiation, the Perimeta A instance is configured with
# minimal configuration, commissioned as an RTP MSC and started.  In addition, it
# will attempt partnering with the B instance when it becomes availble.
#
# During healing, the Perimeta A instance is only configured with sufficient
# configuration to allow partnering from the B instance (which will complete
# the configuration).
#
# This template assumes that a base template stack has previously been
# created so that deployment wide resources such as server-groups have been
# defined.
#
# A perimeta deployment can support one or more RTP MSCs. The parameter
# rtp_msc_a_index is used to make sure that the appropriate settings for this
# RTP MSC are extracted from the various address and server group arrays.
