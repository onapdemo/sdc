  The home subscriber server (HSS), or user profile server function (UPSF), 
  is a master user database that supports the IMS network entities that actually handle calls. 
  It contains the subscription-related information (subscriber profiles), 
  performs authentication and authorization of the user, and can provide information about the 
  subscriber's location and IP information.
